## Configuration to display a DataView in a ListView or DataGrid

- ReportDefinition defines the data access methods to query for a DataView.
- ColumnDefinition defines the display configuration of each column within a ListView or DataGrid
- ReportUtility defines many convenience methods to work with the ReportDefinition

The objective of the library is to allow the display configuration of a DataView to be saved as XML data and not hard-coded within the application. This allows application users to define additional reports when needed.
